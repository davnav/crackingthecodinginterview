# cracking the coding interview

1. This is my coding "cracking the coding interview book" examples solutions - ( Amazon/Microsoft, Don't tell me I didn't do this )
2. The solutions will be in python ( I guess that I am doing it in python2.7 )
3. You might also need to check the version if made some modifications/improvments.
